# RunescapeBot
My personal old-school runescape bot

---

## Features
- mining a single rock given the proper screenshots of it mined/unmined
- random clicking based on a given range (to avoid getting banned)
- linear movement of mouse instead of teleporting mouse points (to avoid getting banned)
- random clicking times based on a given interval (to avoid getting banned)
- checking if the inventory is full
- walking to the bank, storing and walking back to that location

---

## To-Do List
- the option of dropping everything in inventory
- code to easily find and screenshot new spot
- code to move the screen to the reset position (click compass and press up button)
- mining different resources
