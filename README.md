## Features
### Mining Loop
- mining a single rock given the proper screenshots of it mined/unmined (detects when to hit and when not to hit)
- random clicking based on a given range (to avoid getting banned)
- linear movement of mouse instead of teleporting mouse points 
- random clicking times based on a given interval 

### Bank Loop
- checking if the inventory is full, if so, return to the bank and deposit items
- walking to the bank, storing and walking back to that location
- walking now takes less time due to image matching when walking from one point to another; also means the character is unaffected by loading times now
- easier path setup, can use on any route to anywhere basically

## To-Do List
- the option of running to and fro from the bank
- tutorial of how to setup routes and mining
- the option of dropping everything in inventory
- code to easily find and screenshot new spot
- code to move the screen to the reset position (click compass and press up button)
- mining different resources
